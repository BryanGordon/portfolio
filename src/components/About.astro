      I started studying at the University and then as an autodidact. <strong>Been developing software since 2017, in 2021 started with front end development</strong> with some frameworks. On my beginnings learn about backend and <strong>usually use Java, C#, and some databases as Microsoft Server, MySQL and PostgreSQL</strong>. Did some applications like store managers, and the project more relevant was a diet generator system for a real nutritionist. Now <strong>I continue development some backend projects with GO</strong>. On front end development I have different projects simple or more complex, always <strong>to offer a good user experience and good design</strong>. To do this I usually use frameworks as <strong>Astro, Svelte or React</strong> including animations with <strong>GSAP and Framer Motion</strong>, also sometimes I do the <strong>APIs with GO and NodeJs</strong> too.
